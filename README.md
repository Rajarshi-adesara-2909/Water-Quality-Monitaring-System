# Water-Quality-Monitoring-System  
**Ensuring Pure Water Through Intelligent Monitoring**

## Overview

The **Water-Quality-Monitoring-System** is an open-source hardware and software solution designed to monitor and assess water quality in real time. The system integrates multiple sensors to measure critical water parameters such as **pH**, **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)**, **turbidity**, and **temperature**, providing actionable insights into water safety and purity.

This project is suitable for applications in domestic water monitoring, environmental studies, agriculture, and educational or research environments.

## Features

- **Multi-Parameter Sensing**  
  Measures pH, TDS, turbidity, and temperature for a comprehensive water quality profile.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**  
  Displays live sensor readings on an LCD for immediate visibility.

- **Temperature Compensation**  
  Improves TDS accuracy by adjusting readings based on water temperature.

- **Modular and Extensible Design**  
  Sensor modules can be replaced, upgraded, or expanded as required.

- **Water Safety Indicators**  
  LEDs or visual indicators signal whether measured values fall within safe thresholds.

## Built With

- Microcontroller platform (e.g., Arduino-compatible board)
- Water quality sensors (pH, TDS, turbidity, temperature)
- LCD display module
- Embedded firmware (language dependent on microcontroller)

> **Note:** Specific hardware models and libraries may vary based on implementation.
